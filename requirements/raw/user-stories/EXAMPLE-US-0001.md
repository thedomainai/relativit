1. The Setup: High Stakes & Tight Deadlines
Who: Tanaka (28), an Associate at a top-tier Venture Capital firm.

The Mission: Due Diligence for a new investment opportunity: an "AI x Research SaaS" startup.

The Goal: Organize all arguments and make a final investment recommendation by the partner meeting.

The Constraint: The meeting is in 3 days.

2. The Problem: Drowning in the "LLM Sprawl"
Action: Tanaka starts deep-diving into market size, competitors, and technical moats using Claude and ChatGPT.

The Result:

5 different chat threads are now open.

Each thread has 20-30 back-and-forth turns.

Countless sub-points have branched off in every direction.

The Symptoms:

"Wait, which thread did I discuss TAM in?"

"I know I asked about Competitor X, but what was the conclusion?"

"Oh no, I totally forgot to dig into that one risk factor..."

The Emotion: Anxiety and exhaustion. The irony hits him: "I'm using AI to be faster, but I feel less efficient."

3. The Failed Solutions (Why current tools don't work)
Attempt 1: Manual Notes in Notion. He tries copying key points to Notion, but it requires constant updating. He gives up immediately.

Attempt 2: Naming Threads. He tries titling threads like "Market" or "Tech," but discussions drift, and titles can't capture the nuance.

Attempt 3: The "Summarize This" Prompt. He asks the LLM to summarize the chat. It outputs a long wall of text, but it fails to highlight what is missing.

Conclusion: He realizes he has no choice but to re-read every single thread. He is back to square one.

4. The Solution: Enter "Relativity"
Scene 1: The Spark.

Tanaka types: "I want to make an investment decision on this AI SaaS."

Action: A root node "◉ Investment Decision" automatically appears in the right pane.

Reaction: "Oh? It’s starting something."

Scene 2: Auto-Structuring.

As the conversation flows, the Issue Tree grows in real-time. Branches like "Market Opportunity," "Competitive Landscape," and "Team Execution" sprout automatically.

Reaction: "It's organizing my thoughts... on its own!"

Scene 3: You Are Here.

They dive deep into technical details. A "NOW" badge glows on the specific branch of the tree they are discussing.

Reaction: "I know exactly where I am in the big picture."

Scene 4: The Magic Link.

The next day, Tanaka starts a fresh chat thread: "Tell me more about Competitor X."

Action: Relativity automatically links this new conversation to the existing "Competition > Incumbents" node in the tree.

Reaction: "Whoa, it connected the dots across different threads!"

Scene 5: The Gap Analysis.

Day before the meeting. Tanaka looks at the Issue Tree.

Action: He sees empty nodes for "○ Barriers to Entry" and "○ Team Execution."

Reaction: "That was close! I almost missed these points. Let's drill down now."

5. The Payoff: A Second Brain
Before: Drowning in a sea of 5 threads and 100 fragmented messages.

After: One single, living Issue Tree that shows the whole picture and the current status.

Emotional Shift:

From "Messy" → to "Structured."

From "Fear of missing out" → to "Clarified remaining tasks."

From "Where was that?" → to "It's right here."

Tanaka's Verdict: "This isn't just a chatbot. It's like having another 'me' facilitating my thinking process."

6. Visual Flow for the Demo Video
Empty Workspace: "Okay, let's do this." (Anticipation)

First Prompt: Root Node appears. "It reacts." (Engagement)

Conversation: Tree grows dynamically. "It organizes itself!" (Surprise)

Deep Dive: NOW badge moves. "I'm never lost." (Relief)

New Thread: Links to the same tree. "It's all connected!" (Delight)

Overview: Identifying missing nodes. "No blind spots." (Confidence)
